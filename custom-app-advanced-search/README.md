# Advanced Search Functionality in Custom Application
I implemented advanced search into a custom application that is used to manage property insurance policies for businesses. This search functionality 
allows a user to search for records by policy number, property address, or invoice number. A list of policy holders is returned with a few pieces of
basic information and a link to view thorough details about the policy holder.
