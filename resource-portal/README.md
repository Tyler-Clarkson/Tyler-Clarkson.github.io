# Resource Portal

Live solution found at https://www.swbc.com/resources

This webpage was developed on the Evoq platform by DNN, and the solution utilizes their microservices solution, Liquid Content. The benefit to Liquid Content
is that the buisness can define their use cases and requirements, and a solution can be developed to allow them to create content, unassisted -- as long as the
requirements were well defined and the developed use case(s) apply.

The Content Types were defined for each component, and then the visualizers were developed to implement the look and feel. Now, all the business has to do is
create more Content Items of that specific Content Type, and the items will automatically be pulled in via the visualzier. 

## Note:
The vizualers are developed in a GUI within the Evoq platform, so these text files do not exactly represent the solution. For example, the template files were 
created using semantic sectioning comments and combining the template sections into a single file. The template CSS was broken out into its own separate file.
